# Sensor-and-sensor-circuit-design

●	Understand how to specify the proper thermal, flow, or rotary sensor for taking real-time process data. 
●	Implement thermal sensors into an embedded system in both hardware and software.
●	Add the sensor and sensor interface into a microprocessor based development kit.
●	Create hardware and firmware to process sensor signals and feed data to a microprocessor for further evaluation.
●	Study sensor signal noise and apply proper hardware techniques to reduce it to acceptable levels.
